# sixteen-dev 🤖

A collection of open source AI experiments, agent frameworks, and developer tools. We explore the bleeding edge of autonomous agents, building, breaking, and sharing what we learn along the way.

## What We Build 🔨

- 🧠 **AI Agents** - Autonomous agents designed to reason, plan, and execute complex tasks
- 🛠️ **Agent Tooling** - Infrastructure and utilities that make building agents faster and more reliable
- ⚡ **Experiments** - Rapid prototypes pushing the boundaries of what AI systems can do
